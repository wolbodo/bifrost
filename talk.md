## Hi, I'm Dexter

## The problem

### Too much time on my hand?

It can't be time, I'm also renovating a house and I've recently became a father. So I've got plenty of time

### There's this itch I can't scratch

Doing projects in other tech, always wanting to do some svelte.

### There are these lights that need controlling

DMX lighting mixers are bountiful, but tricky to setup and not for the noob to control, like me.
I want to control them with a simple interface, so other people can also interact with them.

## Situation

Lights, controlled by DMX.

## Solution

- ANSI E1.31 (sACN) protocol to output DMX
- A esp32 microcontroller listening to E1.31
- An application to send the e1.31 packets
